It is considered among the largest temple complexes in the world for the cults of the Theban Triad-Amun, Mut, and Khonsu-almost an uninterrupted series of temples, chapels, pylons, and obelisks spread almost 150 acres.

### 2. Temple of Luxor

Whereas Karnak was the place of the major temple-giving to Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, Luxor was equally monumental for Amenhotep III and Ramses II.

While under-the-spot constructions and additions went on for a few centuries in Karnak, Luxor was chiefly erected during Amenhotep III's reign and was nearly completed during Ramses II's. Fame skirts the huge mammoth main entrance crowned by gargantuan seated statues of Ramses. Immediately after this grand entrance lies a wonderful courtyard that is full of gigantic columns in a striding posture. Do not forget to visit the temple at night for an illuminated beauty.

### 3. Valley of the Kings: Tombs of Pharaohs

The Valley of the Kings is situated a little westwards near the Nile River. Kings Tutankhamun and Ramses II are among those pharaohs, famous in Egypt, who were laid to rest here. There exist more than sixty tombs that keep the ambience of mystery alive. Some of them, at least, have interior walls depicting splendid scenes from the Book of the Dead.

### 2. Philae Temple
